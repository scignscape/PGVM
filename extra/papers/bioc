Hi: I am the editor of the International Journal of Speech Technology and a co-author or co-editor of two forthcoming biomedical volumes; myself and one other author are writing an Elsevier book concerning Covid-19, and I am editing a volume on "Medical Image Processing and Machine Learning".  We have been studying the different formats available for describing lab and "in silico" protocols, and we're particularly interested in how BioCoder is designed.  It would be great to see this approach generalized and made available outside of just biomedical experiments.
