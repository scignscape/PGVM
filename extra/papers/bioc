Hi: I am the editor of the International Journal of Speech Technology and a co-author or co-editor of two forthcoming biomedical volumes; myself and one other author are writing an Elsevier book concerning Covid-19, and I am editing a volume on "Medical Image Processing and Machine Learning."  We have been studying the different formats available for describing lab and "in silico" protocols, including BioCoder.  BioCoder's design is very innovative (as far as using a procedural basis for notating protocol description and also generating description files via the procedural code).  It would be great to see this approach generalized and made available outside of just biomedical experiments.  With that in mind, I'm hoping to incorporate a version of BioCoder into a new framework for encoding/describing data sets.  The goal of this framework is to unify several different standards which publishers currently use to represent data-sets' meta-data and the guidelines for how data-sets should be curated (e.g. Research Objects, schema.org/Dataset, Digital Curation Center, etc.)  One component of many data-sets is research protocol descriptions in formats like MIBBI or CDISC.  We'd like to use BioCoder as a code library for this aspect of data-set encoding, updating the code somewhat to integrate with other C++ libraries that are part of the framework.  There is a section outlining these ideas in a White Paper that we have written about this framework.  I'm taking the liberty of attaching this paper if you're interested (if you don't like attachments, it can also be accessed on a GitHub repo at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mosaic-DigammaDB/CRCR/master/SDRF.pdf).  We'd appreciate any feedback or thoughts you may have on this way of using BioCoder.  We'd also like to inquire whether MS Research India (or New England) or Cytomotors would be interested in using or incorporating the overall framework, which can be tailored to individual publishers/research institutions.
